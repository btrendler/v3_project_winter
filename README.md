## Introduction

A typical sleep cycle consists of various stages of REM (rapid eye movement) 
and NREM (non-REM) sleep states. These sleep stages can be identified 
by their relationship to brain activity. Lower brain activity indicates
a deeper sleep state, while higher brain activity indicates wide-awakeness.
Our goal with this project is to find a predictive model between the measured 
metrics and the annotated sleep states. 

Additionally, we seek to explore predicting future brain activity and sleep states using 
Reservoir Computing and Kalman Filtering. Succesful models in these areas will help with
sleep studies and may help create hardware which can identify a userâ€™s sleep
state in real time, to help improve our understanding of the sleep states and
their purposes, especially those with sleeping disorders.

## File Structure
animations -- various visualizations of the brainwaves over time for patients 4001 and 4111.

figures -- figures used in the paper.

projections -- the projected data from using tsne and umap

aggregator.py -- used for aggregating the data -- takes the data from all patients and converts
it to several numpy arrays that are ready for forier analysis.
